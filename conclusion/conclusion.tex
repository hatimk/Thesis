\chapter*{Conclusion}

	This work introduces a thorough methodology to enhance turn-taking capabilities of spoken dialogue systems. First, turn-taking mechanisms involved in human conversation are analysed which led to the establishment of a new turn-taking phenomena taxonomy. Compared to existing classifications in the literature, new analysis dimensions where the meaning behind the dialogue participants behaviours as well as the motivations behind them are considered. This leads to a more fine-grained taxonomy and second and it is more adapted to the human-machine dialogue point of view. Also, this constitutes the starting point from which the turn-taking phenomena that are the more likely to improve the dialogue efficiency are chosen.
