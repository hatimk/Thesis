Reload Preview Document and resize/move window on the right side of screen

By benoit.favre@univ-avignon.fr 2006-08-15
Inspired from the reload script by Trevor Harmon <trevor@vocaro.com>

1) make Preview scriptable :
add theses lines to /Applications/Preview/Contents/Info.plist
    <key>NSAppleScriptEnabled</key>
    <string>YES</string>
before </dict>

2) call "osascript reload.txt document.pdf" from a command line

on reload_document(doc)
	
	-- Make sure the document in question is the frontmost window
	do shell script "open -a Preview " & doc
	
	-- close document
	delay 0.1
	tell application "Preview"
		close window 1
	end tell
	
	-- reopen it
	delay 0.1
	do shell script "open -a Preview " & doc
	
	-- move and resize (wait for the folder to show)
	delay 0.5
	tell application "Preview"
		tell front window
			set bounds to {620, 0, 1270, 750}
		end tell
	end tell
	
end reload_document

on run argv
	my reload_document(item 1 of argv)
end run
